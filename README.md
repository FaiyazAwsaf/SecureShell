# SecureShell
Welcome to SecureShell, a command-line application developed in C++ using modern C++ libraries. This application enables users to efficiently navigate the Windows file system, execute cmd-let operations, and manage files with enhanced security features. SecureShell also supports multi-language program compilation with a single command, providing a seamless development experience. Additionally, users can encrypt and decrypt files using various encryption techniques and secure sensitive data with built-in password management functionalities.

## **Motivation Behind the Project**

SecureShell Terminal was born out of our interest for cybersecurity and the desire to create a tool that bridges the gap between traditional command-line interfaces and modern security practices. We aimed to explore and implement secure file handling, encryption, and password management from scratch
