# PasswordManager.cpp Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues

1. **Massive Code Duplication**: The same functions (loadPasswords, savePasswords, changeMasterPassword, encryptPassword, decryptPassword, generatePassword) appear multiple times throughout the file.

2. **Redundant Implementations**: The same functionality is implemented multiple times with slight variations.

3. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Cryptographic operations, file I/O, and password management are all mixed together in one class.

4. **Excessive File Size**: At over 2000 lines, the file is difficult to maintain and understand.

## Proposed Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Split into Multiple Classes

Create separate classes for different responsibilities:

- **PasswordManager**: Core password management functionality
- **PasswordCrypto**: Encryption/decryption and hashing operations
- **PasswordStorage**: File I/O and persistence operations

### 2. Eliminate Duplicated Code

- Remove all duplicated function implementations
- Create helper functions for common operations
- Use proper abstraction to avoid repetition

### 3. Improve File Organization

- Move each class to its own header and implementation file
- Group related functionality together
- Use namespaces to organize code

### 4. Enhance Maintainability

- Add better comments and documentation
- Improve error handling
- Add unit tests for each component

## Implementation Plan

1. Create new header files for each proposed class
2. Refactor functionality into appropriate classes
3. Update existing code to use the new class structure
4. Remove duplicated code
5. Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is preserved

## Expected Benefits

- Reduced code size (estimated 70-80% reduction)
- Improved maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to extend and modify
- More testable code structure
